First Assignment for CodeDay
Hello, World! My name is Natalie and I am a rising Junior at the University of Florida. I am originally from Santa Cruz, Bolivia but I moved to the United States to pursue a degree in Computer Science. My dad is a Software Engineer, so quite a bit of my passion for coding comes from him. This is my first internship-style experience and I can not wait to dive into my project!
